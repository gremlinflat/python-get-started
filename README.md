# python-get-started
dear future self,

Welcome to your python learning journal

this repo created for dumping source code and journaling my progress of learning python.
hosnestly i learnt programming w/ python around 2013 for minecraft purposes (just copy-paste & modified original code), but today (april 10th, 2020) i had to learn it on different way(more like academic way).

i know you must be desperate so you try to dig some happines form the past (like i used to be, //yeah boi i know you better)
maybe you're laughting right now and/or crying, its okay just like spiegel said "whatever happens, happens".

Thank you for visiting your old repo. im proud of you whatever you're doing

sincerely, your unhappy (too) teenager self
